                    <hr>
                    <p>Dzilam Gonzales is a town located 80 km northeast of the city of Merida, and 10 km
                        from the port of
                        Dzilam de
                        Bravo in Yucatan. This town is commonly known for its various archaeological remains, which
                        unfortunately
                        over the years the volume of these was decreasing. It is also known for its friendly and
                        hard-working
                        people, who work mainly in agriculture and fishing. </p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>There are 3 foods that come to my mind when I think of Dzilam Gonzalez:</p>
                    <div class="comidas">
                        <h3>Enchiladas campechanas or Chalupas yucatecas</h3>
                        <p>Chalupas yucatecas are made of fried dough that is previously kneaded into a rectangle shape,
                            to which is added handmade tomato sauce and grated cheese, a delight!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comidas">
                        <h3>Cochinita</h3>
                        <p>Cochinita is very famous in the state of Yucatan, but as every good Yucatecan would say "It
                            tastes better the one from my town".</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comidas">
                        <h3>Relleno Negro</h3>
                        <p>Relleno negro is a dish from the gastronomy of the Yucatecan peninsula, based on turkey, pork
                            and a mixture of chiles. It is traditionally prepared in the month of November in a festival
                            called Hanal Pix√°n.</p>

                    <h1>Archeology</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The vestiges of Dzilam are not only composed of the two pyramids or "hills" that most of the
                        inhabitants of this town know, but there are numerous smaller constructions of which there are
                        still
                        remains, sometimes almost imperceptible.</p>
                    <p>Dzilam is best known in Maya archaeology because of two stelae, stone monuments portraying their
                        rulers, which provide information regarding dates and events related to them. Fray Diego de
                        Landa
                        made mention of numerous stelae in this place, which stood out for their large dimensions</p>
                    <p>It also has small cenotes that are located both within the town and in the surrounding area.</p>

                    <h1>My brief but wonderful time in Dzilam Gonzalez</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>After my parents had their first separation, I didn't have a fixed home, I moved house or town
                        constantly whenever there were problems. There were several times that my sister and I stayed in
                        Dzilam Gonzales for a while, however, it wasn't until high school that things seemed to work
                        out; my
                        sister stayed with my mother in Motul (the separation with my sister was very hard) and I stayed
                        in
                        Dzilam Gonzales with my father at my grandparents' house. I usually speak wonders of this town
                        because it was there where I had fantastic experiences, in high school my passion for basketball
                        was
                        born and I was given the opportunity to exploit that passion with a lot of hard work; managing
                        to
                        get with the selection of Yucatan and soon help me financially to pay for my studies at the
                        University. I also met incredible people, with an excellent vibe, I learned to play the guitar,
                        I
                        was even part of a Trio of serenades where I met one of my best friends Eduardo.</p>
